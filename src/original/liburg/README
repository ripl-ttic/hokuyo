Source code derived from urg-0.8.11, supplied by Hokuyo.  
All code in this directory is now LGPL (it used to be GPL).

The code for the driver was initially split into 3 subdirectories (and libraries)
urg-0.8.11/src/c/connection
urg-0.8.11/src/c/system
urg-0.8.11/src/c/urg

All the .c and .h files from these folders got merged into the single liburg folder.
Hopefully this is all that will be required if a future update is required.
